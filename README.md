Hangman:

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.
If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. 
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark.
This particular game has 4 themes for the user to choose from which include:
1. Avengers
2. Countries
3. Sports
4. Computers
This repo includes the souce code attached.

Snake Game:

The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.
a sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult.
Source code attached.

Tic-Tac-Toe:

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
but in this case the other player is a computer, which makes amove based on ypur previous move and does not allow the user to win.
